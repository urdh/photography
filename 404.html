  <h1>Oh no!</h1>
  <p>The <abbr>URL</abbr> you visited doesn't point to anything!
    There may be several reasons for this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>A broken link got you here</h5>
      <p>In that case, you should let the author of the previous
        page know that the link is broken, so they can fix it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>The <abbr>URL</abbr> is mis-typed somehow</h5>
      <p>You could either re-type the <abbr>URL</abbr>, or use a
        search enginge to find the page you're looking for.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>What you were looking for never existed</h5>
      <p>If that's the case, I'm afraid I can't help you.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>Whatever got you here, the best way to proceed is probably to
    visit <a href="/">the landing page</a>, or to visit one of
    the collections in the menu to the left.</p>
